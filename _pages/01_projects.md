## R Package: Rd2md

This package creates markdown version of the reference manual for a package. The reference manuals are natively created within R by calling R CMD Rd2pdf.
However, with this package, a more general markdown format is available and could be processed into any other format. For issues, please
use [github](https://github.com/quantsch/Rd2md).

Please use the following code to download the package:

## R Package: Strategy

This package allows users to apply customizable quantitative trading strategies to historical portfolio data.
An S4 class called &quot;Strategy&quot; is implemented that creates objects from which various performance measurements may be extracted, visualized and compared.
A template for custom quantitative strategies is available and so the package can be extended in an easy way and still all methods are available for consistent evaluations.

_Remarks: A fully documented version with vignettes will be available soon._

Please use the following code to download the package:
